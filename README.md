# Rare Events in Random Geometric Graphs
This repository provides Python code for estimating the rare events corresponds to edge count and maximum degree of random geometric graphs on a square window usning the following three methods 

- Naive Monte Carlo;
- Conditional Monte Carlo;
- Importance Sampling based Monte Carlo;
